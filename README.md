# 2D Sprite Animation Program

* This project was developed as an introductory step into the world of 2D animation. Our program demonstrates basic sprite animation techniques, including alignment, separation, and cohesion, inspired by the boids algorithm.

# Introduction
* This project is designed to help us understand and experiment with 2D sprite animation. It uses a set of images representing different animation frames, looping through them to create a smooth animation effect. The sprite can be controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

# Features
* Smooth sprite animation using image frames
* Keyboard controls for sprite movement
* Basic implementation of boids principles:
* Alignment
* Separation
* Cohesion

# How It Works
* The core of this program revolves around the concept of boids, which are used to simulate the flocking behavior of birds. Our implementation focuses on three main principles:
* Alignment: Steering towards the average heading of local flockmates.
* Separation: Steering to avoid crowding local flockmates.
* Cohesion: Steering towards the average position of local flockmates.
* By applying these principles, we create a more natural and coordinated movement of the sprite.
